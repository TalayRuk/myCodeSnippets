## Creating a Csharp Program
Make a file that ends with .cs.  Make sure a runtime is loaded on computer, like Mono).  Here is basics needed for each file.
```csharp
using System;

class Goodbye
{
  static void Main()
  {
    //Everything godes here, like:
    Console.WriteLine("Goodbye World");
  }
}
```

## Creating a C# project with Nancy
You may need to check for the last version
```console
$ dnvm install latest
$ dnvm upgrade
```
Common starting folders
```console
Modules
Views
Content
Tests
Objects
> Startup.cs
> project.json
> readme.md
> xunit.runner.json

> Modules \ HomeModule.cs
> Objects \ ProjectObjects.cs
> Objects \ Database.cs
> Views \ index.cshtml
> Tests \ Tests.cs
> Content \ styles.css
> Content \ scripts.js
```
Small reminders
```cs
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
@Model.
using System.Collections.Generic;
Request.Form[""];
public static List<Contact> DisplayAll()  //Remember that the object is List<Contact>

//Remember that creating a method that is the same as the class is called a constructor and it's a key activity.
```

###### Common namespaces

```cs
using System; //The System namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.
using System.IO; //The System.IO namespace contains types that allow reading and writing to files and data streams, and types that provide basic file and directory suppor
using System.Collections.Generic; //The System.Collections.Generic namespace contains interfaces and classes that define generic collections, which allow users to create strongly typed collections that provide better type safety and performance than non-generic strongly typed collections.
using System.Data; //The System.Data namespace provides access to classes that represent the ADO.NET architecture. ADO.NET lets you build components that efficiently manage data from multiple data sources.
using System.Data.SqlClient; //The System.Data.SqlClient namespace is the.NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server.
using Microsoft.AspNet.Builder; //Identity extensions for IApplicationBuilder. Defines a class that provides the mechanisms to configure an applicationâ€™s request pipeline.
using Nancy; // Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .NET and Mono. Read lots more at their documentation.
using Nancy.Owin; //OWIN defines a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications. The goal of the OWIN interface is to decouple server and application, encourage the development of simple modules for .NET web development, and, by being an open standard, stimulate the open source ecosystem of .NET web development tools.
using Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor; //The Razor engine in Nancy is a custom implementation built around the Razor syntax parser. Please note that the implementation may have differences to the implementation used by ASP.NET MVC.

```


### SetUp
To start a c# program using Nancy (as set up by Epicodus), you need to create a json file that pass a set of dependencies.  The name for this file is **project.json.**  When **> dnu restore** is typed into the command line, it will create a larger json file necessary for the compiler.  This includes telling the program to find the Startup.cs and provides a set of namespaces. File **xunit.runner.json** sets Xunit testing dependencies (needed if you want each test one at a time--like when running tests in databases)

###### project.json
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel": "1.0.0-*",
    "Microsoft.AspNet.Owin": "1.0.0-*",
    "Nancy": "1.3.0",
    "Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor": "1.3.0",
    "xunit": "2.1.0",
    "xunit.runner.dnx": "2.1.0-rc1-*"
  },
  "commands": {
    "kestrel": "Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel --server.urls http://localhost:5004",
    "test": "xunit.runner.dnx"
  },
  "frameworks": {
    "dnx451": {
      "frameworkAssemblies": {
        "System.Data": "4.0.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
###### xunit.runner.json
```json
{
  "parallelizeAssembly" : false,
  "parallelizeTestCollections" : false
}
```

When making a project with Nancy, Nancy looks for a file called **Startup.cs** .  This file will use these namespaces in Startup.cs.  
```cs
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNet.Builder;
using Nancy;
using Nancy.Owin;
using Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor;
```

In the file **Startup.cs** and inside the "primary" project namespace, you will need to add Startup class to set up Nancy working correctly.  If you will be connecting to databases, include another class (conventionally named *DBConfiguration*).  
```cs
namespace ProjectCore
{
  public class Startup
  {
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
      app.UseOwin(x => x.UseNancy());
    }
  }
  public class CustomRootPathProvider : IRootPathProvider
  {
    public string GetRootPath()
    {
      return Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();
    }
  }
  public class RazorConfig : IRazorConfiguration
  {
    public IEnumerable<string> GetAssemblyNames()
    {
      return null;
    }

    public IEnumerable<string> GetDefaultNamespaces()
    {
      return null;
    }

    public bool AutoIncludeModelNamespace
    {
      get { return false; }
    }
  }
  public static class DBConfiguration
  {
//     Epicodus DataBase Information (Microsoft sequl server)
// Server type: Database Engine
// Server name: (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB
// Authentication: Windows Authentication

    public static string dataSource = "Data Source=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb"; // Data Source identifies the server.
    public static string databaseName = "database"; // Initial Catalog is the database name
    //Integrated Security sets the security of the database access to the Windows user that is currently logged in.
    public static string ConnectionString = ""+dataSource+";Initial Catalog="+databaseName+";Integrated Security=SSPI;";
  }
}
```

Additionally, the HomeModule.cs with Nancy should have the code.  The beauty of Nancy is the ease of loading a "View", as seen below. Please note that a index.cshtml file is needed.  
```csharp
using Nancy;

namespace ProjectCore
{
  public class HomeModule : NancyModule
  {
    public HomeModule()
    {
      Get["/"] = _ => {return View["index.cshtml"];};
    }
  }
}

```
From here it is common to put in the database connection information into the objects folder in a file called *Database.cs*. The line *ProjectCore* connects back to the class that we set up in *Startup.cs*.  
```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace ProjectCore
{  
  public class DB
  {
    public static SqlConnection Connection()
    {
      SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(DBConfiguration.ConnectionString);
      return conn;
    }
  }
```



with a cs folder of objects
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace ProjectCore.Objects
{
  public class ProjectCore
  {
    // //Overrides are for typcasting
    //   public override bool Equals(System.Object otherKitten)
    // {
    //   if (!(otherKitten is Kitten))
    //   {
    //     return false;
    //   }
    //   else
    //   {
    //     Kitten newKitten = (Kitten) otherKitten;
    //     return this.GetName().Equals(newKitten.GetName());
    //   }
    // }
    //
    // public override int GetHashCode()
    // {
    //      return this.GetName().GetHashCode();
    // }
  }
}
```
Then ready a tests folder
```c#
using System;
using Xunit;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace Tests
{
  public class Testing : IDisposable
  {
    public ToDoTest()
    {
      string dataSource = "Data Source=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb"; // Data Source identifies the server.
      string databaseName = "database"; // Initial Catalog is the database name
      //Integrated Security sets the security of the database access to the Windows user that is currently logged in.
      DBConfiguration.ConnectionString = ""+dataSource+";Initial Catalog="+databaseName+";Integrated Security=SSPI;";
    }


    public void Dispose()
    {
      // Item.DeleteAll();
    }
  }
}

```

To Memorize:
```cSharp
  List<Task> allTasks = new List<Task>{};

  SqlConnection conn = DB.Connection();
  conn.Open();

  SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM tasks;", conn);
  SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();

  while(rdr.Read())
  {
    int taskId = rdr.GetInt32(0);
    string taskDescription = rdr.GetString(1);
    Task newTask = new Task(taskDescription, taskId);
    allTasks.Add(newTask);
  }

  if (rdr != null)
  {
    rdr.Close();
  }
  if (conn != null)
  {
    conn.Close();        
  }
  return allTasks;


```

## Background on cSharp

From Epicodus LEsson cSharp.
> To have access to C#, we need to install an implementation of the .NET Framework. This will give us and what is called the Common Language Runtime. We recommend using Mono. It's open-source and even better, it's cross-platform.

> C#, pronounced see sharp, began development in the late 90's. Released as a part of the .NET Framework initiative in July 2000, C# is part of a family of computer languages which evolved out of the C/C++ Programming Language, which originated in the late 60's at Bell Labs.

> Today, C# is the object-oriented component of the ASP.NET Framework. Microsoft Chief Architect and C# team leader Anders Hejlsberg described it as an iteration and improvement of the C++ language. Hejlsberg touted C# as "the first component-oriented language in the C/C++ family." As a result, it is " a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language" and to be "economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements".

From Wikipedia
> The Common Language Runtime (CLR), the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework, manages the execution of .NET programs. A process known as just-in-time compilation converts compiled code into machine instructions which the computer's CPU then executes.[1] The CLR provides additional services including memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, security and thread management. All programs written for the .NET framework, regardless of programming language, are executed by the CLR. All versions of the .NET framework include CLR.

> A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code.

## Methods to Remember

```csharp

//char
char =

// strings
string phrase = "Programming is AWESOME";
phrase.ToUpper();
phrase.ToLower();
phrase.Contains(phraseTwo);
string phrase3 = phrase.Replace("hello", "goodbye")
int number = 56;  number.ToString();
" Hi ".Trim();

//ints
string num = "32";
int newNum = int.Parse(num);

//bools
string phrase = "Gosh";
bool answer = phrase.StartsWith("g");
bool answer1 = phrase.EndsWith("o");

//Dictionary
Dictionary<string, string> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>() { {"A", "apple"}, {"B", "bear"} };
```
